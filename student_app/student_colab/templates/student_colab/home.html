      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        COLLAB was created by a group of university students who understand the challenges of connecting with peers in academic environments.
        Our platform bridges that gap by making collaboration easier and more meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value integrity, teamwork, and continuous improvement in everything we do. 
        Our goal is to help students grow together ‚Äî both academically and personally.
